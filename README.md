# Spoof-Mac

Code Breakdown:
Imports:

The script imports the subprocess module to execute system commands and the optparse module to handle command-line arguments.
Function mac_changer(interface, new_mac):

This function takes two parameters: the network interface (e.g., eth0) and the new MAC address.
It changes the MAC address in three steps:
Disable the Interface: Uses subprocess.call() to bring the interface down.
Change the MAC Address: Executes a command to set the new MAC address.
Re-enable the Interface: Brings the interface back up.
A success message is printed after the MAC address has been changed.
Function get_arguments():

This function sets up the command-line argument parser.
It defines two options:
-i or --interface: Specifies the network interface.
-m or --mac: Specifies the new MAC address.
If the user does not provide the required arguments, an error message is displayed.
Execution:

The script retrieves command-line arguments and calls the mac_changer function with the provided options.
Security Consideration:
I focused on security in this code. By using a list in the subprocess.call() method, I prevent users from executing additional commands. For example, if a user enters eth0;ls, it would expose sensitive information. Addressing these small vulnerabilities is crucial for maintaining system integrity. üõ°Ô∏è
